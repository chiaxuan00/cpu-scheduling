# cpu-scheduling
TSN2101 - Operating System Assignment Trimester 1 2020/2021 üë©‚Äçüíª 

Programs written in Java to carry out the simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms.

* Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First 
* Preemptive Shortest Job First 
* Preemptive Priority

Our program can accept user input data with details of arrival time, burst time, and priority of
processes and use preset data from the pre assigned case of assignment. Gantt chart will contain 
the information of arrival time, burst time, finishing time, turnaround time and waiting time of 
each process. Total and average turnaround time as well as total and average waiting time for entire 
processes will be calculated and showed under the Gantt chart.
